<!-- Project language file 1
For: seanpm2001/Learn-ASP.NET
About:
I decided to make ASP.NET (Action Server Pages DOT NET) the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-ASP.NET) as ASP.NET is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the ASP.NET programming language. It only makes sense to ASP.NET the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
